          volume = {53},
        abstract = {Constrained estimators that enforce variable selection and grouping of highly correlated data have been shown to be successful in finding sparse representations and obtaining good performance in prediction. We consider polytopes as a general class of compact and convex constraint regions. Well
established procedures like LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) or OSCAR (Bondell and Reich, 2008) are shown to be based on specific subclasses of polytopes. The general framework of polytopes can be used to investigate the geometric structure that underlies these procedures. Moreover, we propose a specifically designed class of polytopes that enforces variable selection and grouping. Simulation studies and an application illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.},
